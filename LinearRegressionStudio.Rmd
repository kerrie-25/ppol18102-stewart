```{r}
eclsk <- read.csv("eclsk.csv")

## Linear Regression Model


```{r}
readscoremodel <- stan_glm(read ~ female, data=eclsk)
print(readscoremodel)
```

## Scatterplot

```{r}
plot(eclsk$female, eclsk$read, 
     xlab = "Female", ylab = "Reading Score", 
     main = "Reading Score vs. Gender", 
     pch = 19, col = "blue", 
     xaxt = "n") 
abline(readscoremodel, col = "red", lwd = 2)
text(0.5, 50, labels = equation, col = 'green', cex = 1.2)
```
## Intercept and Coefficient
```{r}
intercept <- coef(readscoremodel)
coefficient <- coef(readscoremodel)
```

```{r}
print(intercept)
```
```{r}
print(coefficient)
```
## Equation 
```{r}
```

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
